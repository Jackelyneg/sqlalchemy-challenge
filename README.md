## Climate Analysis and Exploration
Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of climate database.

## Objectives:

- Using SQLAlchemy to create_engine to connect to sqlite database.

-  Using SQLAlchemy to automap_base() to reflect tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called Station and Measurement.

- Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.


## Precipitation Analysis

- With the most recent, I retrieved the average precipitation per day for the previous 12 months. 

- Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

- Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method. 



## Station Analysis
- Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset and that lists all stations with their corresponding observation count in descending order 


- Calculated the lowest, highest, and average temperature for that station id 



## Climate App


- Used Flask to create routes.
